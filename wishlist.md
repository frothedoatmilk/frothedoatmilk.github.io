### What is this?

I find that Amazon wishlists can't contain everything that I want in a meaningful way. Sometimes these are just vague ideas! Sometimes I have a very specific idea. So here's my wishlist!

Santa, if you're reading this, I'm sorry for not writing. I've been very busy.

<ul>
  <li>An apron! I have gotten so many stains without one...</li>
  <li>Just...anything from <a href="https://yesfriends.co">Yes Friends</a>, truly a wonderful company.</li>
  <li>A solid pair of wired earbuds</li>
</ul>
