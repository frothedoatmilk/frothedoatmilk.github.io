### So, who are you?

I'm a Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who loves to cook, read, listen and perform music, and of course, program.

### Why computers? Why not philosophy? Or history?

Growing up as a kid, I loved tinkering with any bit of technology I could
get my hands on. From building [a powered periodic table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urcIdu2K_WU)
with my classmates at the [Las Cruces Academy](https://www.lascrucesacademy.org) to just
trying to get Minecraft to run on a PowerPC processor, I was always trying something new with computers.

So, to answer that question, I just like computers. Why not follow that?

The fun really began with my Computer Science classes in high school. I always found myself pouring more and more time into those classes, whether it was perfecting
a model of wildlife in NetLogo, rounding out the experience on a Python script, or studying the questions for the AP CSA exam, I've always been attracted conversing with computers to solve problems.

I was exposed to a large variety of languages at that time, both through school and my own adventures. That's when I began
to find my love for C and lower level languages.

### So, how's that college thing treating you?

My university studies so far have made me learn so much more than I could
have imagined with computer engineering. From learning every step involved in programming an ATMega328P microcontroller to the behaviors of op-amps and MOSFETs, understanding how to build things which can harness the amazing power of technology is a journey I hope to continue for the rest of my life.

I'm also currently employed at UMass Transit Services as a Full Stack Programmer. This job has given me amazing chances to work on real projects and receive feedback from end-users on a day to day basis. I love seeing the benefits of our improvements and optimizations when I ask my colleagues at Transit about our websites.

### Wait, you like computers a lot...do you do anything else?

- I'm currently the vice president of the Sigma Alpha Chapter of [Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia](https://www.sinfonia.org) at UMass Amherst
- I love to read. A lot. I've been working through various books on [NPR's Books We Love](https://apps.npr.org/best-books/#view=covers&year=2024).
