Thank you for taking the time to visit my site! It really does
mean a lot to me. From my growing up in New Mexico to my studies at
the Manning School at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I've been
on quite the journey.

### Early Life

Growing up as a kid, I loved tinkering with any bit of technology I could
get my hands on. From trying to install Minecraft on a PowerPC (a fruitless
endavour at the time) to building [a powered periodic table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urcIdu2K_WU) with my classmates at the Las Cruces Academy, the desire
to explore the electronic brain began early on.

The fun really began with my Computer Science classes in high school. My principal
achievement throughout those courses was [achieving a perfect score on the AP CSA Exam in 2021.](https://allaccess.collegeboard.org/ap-computer-science-exam-2021-results) But
those classes built some wonderful projects which I hope to upload to my GitHub at some
point in the future.

### University

My university studies so far have made me learn so much more than I could
have imagined with computer science. This journey is still ongoing, but I have become a
member of a number of wonderful student groups, including [Phi Mu Alpha](https://www.sinfonia.org/), a wonderful music fraternity dedicated to spreading
the joys of music.

### Currently

As I continue my studies, I am also employed with some wonderful people at UMass Transit
Services as a Full Stack Programmer using Ruby on Rails to build internal tooling
for the entire company. But I am still seeking summer internships to further broaden
my horizons!
