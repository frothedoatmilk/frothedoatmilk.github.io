### So, who are you?

I'm a Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who loves to cook, read, listen and perform music, and of course, program.

### Why computers? Why not philosophy? Or art?

Growing up as a kid, I loved tinkering with any bit of technology I could
get my hands on. From building [a powered periodic table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urcIdu2K_WU)
with my classmates at the [Las Cruces Academy](https://www.lascrucesacademy.org) to just
trying to get Minecraft to run on a PowerPC processor, I was always trying something new with computers.

So, to answer that question, I just like computers. Why not follow that?

### Every kid likes...a lot of things. What made it stick?

The fun really began with my Computer Science classes in high school. My principal
achievement throughout those courses was achieving a perfect score on the AP CSA Exam in 2022. But
I also built some wonderful projects during my time in high school, ranging from wildlife models in NetLogo
to data-crunching tools in Python.

I was exposed to a large variety of languages at that time, both through school and my own adventures. That's when I began
to find my love for C and lower level languages.

### So, how's that college thing treating you?

My university studies so far have made me learn so much more than I could
have imagined with computer science. From understanding the inner workings of a processor to the abstract
world of discrete math, every day I feel like I turn over another corner of this field I had never thought of.

I'm also currently employed at UMass Transit Services as a Full Stack Programmer working on their internal tooling. This job has introduced me
to the wonderful, wonderful world of Ruby on Rails and the beauty of [omakase programming](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine#omakase).

### Wait, you like computers a lot...do you do anything else?

- Cooking! I've been making a lot of things out of [Evergreen Kitchen's](https://www.evergreenkitchen.ca) cookbook. It's...quite good.
- Music! I'm a member of the Sigma Alpha chapter of [Phi Mu Alpha](https://www.sinfonia.org/) at UMass Amherst, a wonderful organization dedicated to advancing music in America.
- Reading! There's a reason I mentioned philosophy earlier...
